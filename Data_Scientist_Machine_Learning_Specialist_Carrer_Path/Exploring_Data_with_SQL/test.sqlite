-- Exploring Data with SQL

-- Like most organizations, Codecademy uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to access its database.

-- A database is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured into tables. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records.

-- Spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, allow you to view and manipulate data directly: with selecting, filtering, sorting, etc. By applying a number of these operations you can obtain the subset of data you are seeking.

-- SQL (pronounced “S-Q-L” or “sequel”) allows you to write queries which define the subset of data you are seeking. Unlike Excel and Sheets, your computer and SQL will handle how to get the data; you can focus on what data you would like. You can save these queries, refine them, share them, and run them on different databases.

-- It is a great way to access data and a great entry point to programming because its syntax (the specific vocabulary that gives instructions to the computer) is very human-readable. Without knowing any SQL, you might still be able to guess what each command will do.

-- On her first day at Codecademy, Catherine wants to become familiar with the company’s data, so she connects to the database and uses SQL to explore the database.



-- Codecademy’s database is called browse

SELECT *
FROM browse
LIMIT 10;
