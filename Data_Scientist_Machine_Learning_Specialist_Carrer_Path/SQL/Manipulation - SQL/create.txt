CREATE statements allow us to create a new table in the database. You can use the CREATE statement anytime you want to create a new table from scratch. The statement below creates a new table named celebs.

CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER, 
   name TEXT, 
   age INTEGER
);

Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Now that you have a good understanding of SQL syntax, we can create a new table. We’ve cleared the database from the previous exercises. Confirm no celebs table exists by entering the following in the code editor:

SELECT * FROM celebs;

Look at the results. The database should be empty!

Now that we know the database is empty, let’s create a new celebs table.

In the code editor, type:

CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER, 
   name TEXT, 
   age INTEGER
); 

We will learn how to view this table in a later exercise after we have added some data to it.


 SELECT * FROM celebs;
 CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER, 
   name TEXT, 
   age INTEGER
);
