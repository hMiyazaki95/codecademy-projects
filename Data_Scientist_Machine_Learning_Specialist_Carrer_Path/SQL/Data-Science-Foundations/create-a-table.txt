-- Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”.

-- Update her record in friends.

-- Hint
-- The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table:

-- UPDATE table_name
-- SET column1 = value1
-- WHERE condition;

-- Your code should look something like:

-- UPDATE friends
-- SET name = 'Storm'
-- WHERE id = 1;

-- 6.
-- Add a new column named email.

-- Stuck? Get a hint
-- 7.
-- Update the email address for everyone in your table.

-- Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.

-- Stuck? Get a hint
-- 8.
-- Wait, Storm is fictional…

-- Remove her from friends.

-- Stuck? Get a hint
-- 9.
-- Great job! Let’s take a look at the result one last time:

-- SELECT * 
-- FROM friends;


CREATE TABLE friends (
   id INTEGER, 
   name TEXT, 
   birthday DATE
);

-- Insert initial records
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (2, 'Kate', '1940-06-30');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (3, 'Jayson', '1940-07-30');

-- Update the name for id 1
UPDATE friends 
SET name = 'Storm'
WHERE id = 1;

-- Add a new column 'email'
ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN email TEXT;

-- Insert emails for existing records
UPDATE friends
SET email = 'storm@codecademy.com'
WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE friends
SET email = NULL
WHERE id = 2;

UPDATE friends
SET email = NULL
WHERE id = 3;

DELETE FROM friends 
WHERE email IS 'storm@codecademy.com';

-- Select all records to view the table
SELECT * FROM friends;
