Why Learn SQL?
Creating Usage Funnels
3 min
Visitors to Codecademy’s website follow a simple workflow:

Browse items available for sale
Click an icon to begin the checkout process
Enter payment information to complete their purchase
Not all users who browse on the website will find something that they like enough to checkout, and not all users who begin the checkout process will finish entering their payment information to make a purchase.

This type of multi-step process where some users leave at each step is called a funnel.

Catherine wants to determine what percent of users make it through each step of the funnel so that she can recommend improvements to Codecademy’s website.

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed

Catherine is going to combine data from three different tables:

browse - gives the timestamps of users who visited different item description pages
checkout - gives the timestamps of users who visited the checkout page
purchase - gives the timestamps of when users complete their purchase
Using SQL, she finds that 24% of all users who browse move on to checkout. 89% of those who reach checkout purchase.
