Catherine learned and applied a lot during the first two weeks of her job. She:

Wrote basic queries
Calculated aggregates
Combined data from multiple tables
Created usage funnels
Analyzed user churn
Determined web traffic attribution
Now itâ€™s your turn. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be able to do all of the things that Catherine can do.

Good luck and happy coding!
