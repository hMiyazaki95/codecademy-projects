Determining Web Traffic Attribution
1 min
Catherine’s boss asks her to analyze how users are finding Codecademy’s websites using UTM Parameters. UTM Parameters are special tags that site owners add to their pages to track what website a user was on before they reach the website. For instance:

If a user found Codecademy’s website through Google search, the table page_visits might have utm_source set to ‘google’.
If a different user clicked a Facebook ad to get to Codecademy’s website, then their row in page_visits might have utm_source as ‘facebook’.
