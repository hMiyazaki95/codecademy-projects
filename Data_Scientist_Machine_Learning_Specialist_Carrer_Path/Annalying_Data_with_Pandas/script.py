Analyzing Data with Pandas
3 min
Catherine wants to know if Codecademy learners are finding what they need. She needs to analyze data from a survey that was administered to a subset of visitors.

Catherine selects the survey data from the SQL database and downloads it onto her computer. She saves the data as a CSV file (extension .csv), which stands for Comma-Separated Values. CSV is a text-only spreadsheet format that lets us store and explore data.

To analyze the survey data, Catherine will use pandas. Python is a programming language, and pandas is a special set of commands in Python that lets us analyze spreadsheet data. Pandas can do a lot of the things that SQL can do, but itâ€™s also backed by the power of Python, so we can easily transition from analyzing our data with pandas to visualizing it using other Python tools.
