-- Next, Catherine wants to take a look at the churn rate.

-- Churn rate is the percent of subscribers to a monthly service who have canceled. For example, in January, letâ€™s say Codecademy had 1,000 learners. In February, 200 learners sign up, and 250 cancel.

-- The churn rate for February would be:

-- cancellations / total subscribers = 250 / 1000 + 200 = 20.8%

        THEN user_id

 	ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE
       	WHEN strftime("%m", cancel_date) = '03'
        THEN user_id
  END) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) AS 'churn_rate'
