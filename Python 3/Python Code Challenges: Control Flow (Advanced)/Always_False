3. Always False
There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it. Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction. It will contain a few steps:

Define the function to accept a single parameter called num
Use a combination of <, > and and to create a contradiction in an if statement.
If the condition is true, return True, otherwise return False. The trick here is that because we’ve written a contradiction, the condition should never be true, so we should expect to always return False.

'''
Create a function named always_false() that has one parameter named num.

Using an if statement, your variable num, and the operators >, and <, make it so your function will return False no matter what number is stored in num.

An if statement that is always false is called a contradiction. You will rarely want to do this while programming, but it is important to realize it is possible to do this.

# Write your always_false function here:
def always_false(num):
  if num > 0 or num < 0 or num == 0:
    return False
  else:
    return True
# Uncomment these function calls to test your always_false function:
print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False
