# Sal's Shipping
# Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal‚Äôs Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.

# In this project, you‚Äôll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal‚Äôs Shippers.

# Sal‚Äôs Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

# Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
# Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren‚Äôt charged for weight.
# Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
# Here are the prices:

# Ground Shipping

# Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
# 2 lb or less	$1.50	$20.00
# Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$3.00	$20.00
# Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$4.00	$20.00
# Over 10 lb	$4.75	$20.00

# Ground Shipping Premium

# Flat charge: $125.00

# Drone Shipping

# Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
# 2 lb or less	$4.50	$0.00
# Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$9.00	$0.00
# Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$12.00	$0.00
# Over 10 lb	$14.25	$0.00

# Write a shipping.py Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal‚Äôs Shippers.

# Note that the walkthrough video for this project is slightly out of date ‚Äî the walkthrough was done using a version of this project that uses functions. Feel free to come back to the video after having been introduced to functions!

# Ground Shipping:
# 1.
# First things first, define a weight variable and set it equal to any number.

# Stuck? Get a hint
# 2.
# Next, we need to know how much it costs to ship a package of given weight by normal ground shipping based on the ‚ÄúGround shipping‚Äù table above.

# Write a comment that says ‚ÄúGround Shipping‚Äù.

# Create an if/elif/else statement for the cost of ground shipping. It should check for weight, and print the cost of shipping a package of that weight.

# Ground Shipping Premium:
# 4.
# We‚Äôll also need to make sure we include the price of premium ground shipping in our code.

# Create a variable for the cost of premium ground shipping.

# Note: This does not need to be an if statement because the price of premium ground shipping does not change with the weight of the package.

# Drone Shipping:

# Write a comment for this section of the code, ‚ÄúDrone Shipping‚Äù.

# Create an if/elif/else statement for the cost of drone shipping. This statement should check against weight and print the cost of shipping a package of that weight.
